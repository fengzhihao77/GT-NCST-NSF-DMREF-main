        <h2>About the Repository</h2>
        <p>
          This repository hosts and maintains the research website for the NSF-DMREF Award (#2324190) jointly led by Georgia Tech and NCSU. It serves as a central hub for sharing project updates, team member information, research outputs, data, and tools. The goal is to provide a transparent and organized platform for collaborators, funding agencies, and the broader scientific community to stay informed about ongoing work and outcomes.<br>
          <br>
          The project is part of the NSF's Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) initiative and focuses on advancing fundamental knowledge related to materials design and processing through advanced testing methodology, theory, computation, and leveraging machine learning and data mining towards accelerated materials discovery in the organic semiconductor field; and we are addressing current challenges in polymer semiconductor materials discovery. This combination of theory, automated experimentation, detailed structural characterization, and machine learning approaches will enable predictive tools of this complex space to be realized.
