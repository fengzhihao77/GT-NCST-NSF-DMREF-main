          <p>Simulated conformations and configurations of semiconducting polymers illustrating how side-chain architecture influences solid-state packing, highlighting the interplay between side-chain design and polymer assembly captured via MD simulations with the <em>pyForceTune</em>-optimized force field.</p>

          <h3>Structure-Property Relationships</h3>
          <p>We work to reveal how the local structure of polymer semiconductors influences their optoelectronic properties. By first studying the conformation of the polymer in solution, we can then better understand how different environmental and processing conditions impact optoelectronic properties in the solid state. To this end, we employ a variety of advanced structural probes (light scattering, fast-scanning calorimetry, solid-state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, etc.). The physical structure is then correlated with the optoelectronic or electrochemical response.</p>

          <h3>ATLAS: Automated Identification of Thermal Transitions in Thin Films </h3>
          <p>We present a fast, reliable, and reproducible method to measure thermal transitions in thin films using in-situ UVvis measurements and automated data analysis. Our approach utilizes a normalized deviation metric (NDM) of the absorbance and changing spectral characteristics as a function of temperature. Thermal transitions are automatically identified through applying a piecewise linear regression (PLR) analysis to the semilogarithmic NDM. The PLR is also applied to changes in spectral absorbance features, providing further support for thermal transition identification. We refer to this approach as Automated Thermal transition identification using Linear regression analysis of the Absorbance Spectra (ATLAS).</p>

          <h3>Crystallite Orientations</h3>
          <p>In this project, we work to understand the formation of face-on and edge-on orientations using Grazing Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering, providing a unified picture of crystallites orientations in conjugated polymers thin films. Understanding crystallites orientation and having the ability to control thin films' microstructure would be an important step toward advancing the development of organic electronic devices.</p>

          <h3>Densification</h3>
          <p>This project investigates densification, a common phenomenon in solution-cast conjugated polymer films, which arises from two key sources: trapped residual solvent from vitrification and additional free volume in quenched films. Residual solvent becomes kinetically trapped when films vitrify before complete evaporation, acting as a plasticizer responsible for significant densification, while excess free volume from rapid solvent evaporation creates a non-equilibrium state that drives further structural reorganization. We provide a systematic exploration of why differences in densification occur across different polymer-solvent combinations, examining how material properties and processing parameters influence the extent and kinetics of this evolution. Notably, there is a pronounced thickness dependence on densification, revealing confinement effects where thinner films exhibit altered relaxation dynamics due to interfacial interactions becoming dominant at reduced dimensions. This work establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding and controlling structural evolution in conjugated polymer thin films.</p>

          <h3>SemiOrg (An Open Data Infrastructure Initiative)</h3>
          <p>SemiOrg is an open data infrastructure initiative for experimental data on conjugated polymers and related organic semiconductors. Experimental reproducibility remains one of the most persistent challenges in materials research, especially for soft and organic systems where processing variability and incomplete metadata hinder validation and modeling. Inconsistent data formats and limited support for machine learning workflows worsen this bottleneck. These issues slow down discovery and make it difficult for researchers to build on each other’s results. SemiOrg addresses these problems through a unified approach that captures synthesis, processing, and multimodal characterization data and metadata. 

          SemiOrg brings together a data lake, data lakehouse, a synthetic lab for realistic multimodal data generation, and a user dashboard comprising of a materials informatics, cheminformatics, and exploratory data analysis and visualization suite. An “open-source playground” is actively being developed to connect researchers directly to external AI models and digital-lab tools from organizations such as IBM, NVIDIA, and NIST. Researchers can apply pretrained models to FAIR-formatted datasets within a reproducible sandbox. This architecture transforms how scientific data is stored, shared, and reused, establishing a foundation for accelerated discovery and continuous learning across disciplines. Long-term goals include the development of an automated lab facility that generates reliable, reproducible data for the global research community for reference, and unify synthetic and real data under one reproducible framework. </p>

          <h3>Training Next-Generation Scientists & Engineers</h3>
          <p>Organic and carbon electronics are rarely covered in traditional materials science curriculums despite their increasing utility in energy, energy storage, biomedicine, and sensor applications. Research projects generally do not provide undergraduate students with experience using advanced characterization techniques. This project gives undergraduates a structured introduction to polymer semiconductors and the advanced techniques required to characterize them. Students are directly engaged with processing-structure relationships that govern modern organic electronics. They learn how solvent choice and thermal history shape microstructure in donor-acceptor polymers, and they develop hands-on experience in thin-film fabrication, substrate preparation, profilometry, glovebox operation, and GIWAXS characterization. By guiding students through solvent-induced and thermally driven texture transitions, the project builds practical laboratory skills while deepening their understanding of morphology, molecular packing, and their connections to electronic properties. Through experimentation, data analysis, and a final poster presentation, participants gain the scientific literacy, independence, and research communication needed to enter graduate study, industry roles, or advanced research roles in polymer science and organic electronics. </p>
