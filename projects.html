          <h3>Computational Modeling</h3>
          <p>Simulated conformations and configurations of semiconducting polymers illustrating how side-chain architecture influences solid-state packing, highlighting the interplay between side-chain design and polymer assembly captured via MD simulations with the <em>pyForceTune</em>-optimized force field.</p>

          <h3>Structure-Property Relationships</h3>
          <p>We work to reveal how the local structure of polymer semiconductors influences their optoelectronic properties. By first studying the conformation of the polymer in solution, we can then better understand how different environmental and processing conditions impact optoelectronic properties in the solid state. To this end, we employ a variety of advanced structural probes (light scattering, fast-scanning calorimetry, solid-state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, etc.). The physical structure is then correlated with the optoelectronic or electrochemical response.</p>

          <h3>Densification</h3>
          <p>This project investigates densification, a common phenomenon in solution-cast conjugated polymer films, which arises from two key sources: trapped residual solvent from vitrification and additional free volume in quenched films. Residual solvent becomes kinetically trapped when films vitrify before complete evaporation, acting as a plasticizer responsible for significant densification, while excess free volume from rapid solvent evaporation creates a non-equilibrium state that drives further structural reorganization. We provide a systematic exploration of why differences in densification occur across different polymer-solvent combinations, examining how material properties and processing parameters influence the extent and kinetics of this evolution. Notably, there is a pronounced thickness dependence on densification, revealing confinement effects where thinner films exhibit altered relaxation dynamics due to interfacial interactions becoming dominant at reduced dimensions. This work establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding and controlling structural evolution in conjugated polymer thin films.</p>
