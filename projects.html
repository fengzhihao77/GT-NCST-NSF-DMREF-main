          <h3>Computational Modeling</h3>
          <p>Simulated conformations and configurations of semiconducting polymers illustrating how side-chain architecture influences solid-state packing, highlighting the interplay between side-chain design and polymer assembly captured via MD simulations with the <em>pyForceTune</em>-optimized force field.</p>

          <h3>Structure-Property Relationships</h3>
          <p>We work to reveal how the local structure of polymer semiconductors influences their optoelectronic properties. By first studying the conformation of the polymer in solution, we can then better understand how different environmental and processing conditions impact optoelectronic properties in the solid state. To this end, we employ a variety of advanced structural probes (light scattering, fast-scanning calorimetry, solid-state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, etc.). The physical structure is then correlated with the optoelectronic or electrochemical response.</p>

          <h3>Densification</h3>
          <p>This project investigates densification, a common phenomenon in solution-cast conjugated polymer films, which arises from two key sources: trapped residual solvent from vitrification and additional free volume in quenched films. Residual solvent becomes kinetically trapped when films vitrify before complete evaporation, acting as a plasticizer responsible for significant densification, while excess free volume from rapid solvent evaporation creates a non-equilibrium state that drives further structural reorganization. We provide a systematic exploration of why differences in densification occur across different polymer-solvent combinations, examining how material properties and processing parameters influence the extent and kinetics of this evolution. Notably, there is a pronounced thickness dependence on densification, revealing confinement effects where thinner films exhibit altered relaxation dynamics due to interfacial interactions becoming dominant at reduced dimensions. This work establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding and controlling structural evolution in conjugated polymer thin films.</p>

          <h3>Training Next-Generation Scientists & Engineers</h3>
          <p>Organic and carbon electronics are rarely covered in traditional materials science curriculums despite their increasing utility in energy, energy storage, biomedicine, and sensor applications. Research projects generally do not provide undergraduate students with experience using advanced characterization techniques. This project gives undergraduates a structured introduction to polymer semiconductors and the advanced techniques required to characterize them. Students are directly engaged with processing-structure relationships that govern modern organic electronics. They learn how solvent choice and thermal history shape microstructure in donor-acceptor polymers, and they develop hands-on experience in thin-film fabrication, substrate preparation, profilometry, glovebox operation, and GIWAXS characterization. By guiding students through solvent-induced and thermally driven texture transitions, the project builds practical laboratory skills while deepening their understanding of morphology, molecular packing, and their connections to electronic properties. Through experimentation, data analysis, and a final poster presentation, participants gain the scientific literacy, independence, and research communication needed to enter graduate study, industry roles, or advanced research roles in polymer science and organic electronics. </p>
